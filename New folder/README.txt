==== Description===


the program contains two functions:
1) word_counter: that gets the input of a char and counts how many words are there in a scentence

2) word_letter_printer: that functions gets a char (sentence) it counts how many letters are there in each word in a sentence by getting the first word and makes sure that when there is  a letter and after that a space it means that the word is gonna end so we print the current charcounter and restart the character counter again till we reach the end of the sentence

Finally in main we allocate memory for a char (string) and get the input from user 
if the input == "end" then we stop getting input from user .. else: we keep on getting the input and display the counted words and letters in each input 
and of course freeing memory after stopping the loop.
